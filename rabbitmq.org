** queue
 is a buffer that stores messages.
** consumer

** exchange
4 types: direct, topic, headers and fanout

Durable exhange -- survives broker restart 

durable queues and messages 

If you need a stronger guarantee then you can use publisher confirms.

*** Direct exchange
Ideal for one consumer (but can be used for many).

Message recieved by only one consumer.

Can be used for simple round-robin load balancing.

*** Fanout exhange

Message routed to all consumer. 

Routing key is ignored. 


*** Topic exchange

Message routed to one or many queues based on matching between a message routing key and the pattern that was used to bind a quque to an exchange.

*** Headers exchange
