* PHP

** Serialization 

It could be json_encode (most multiplatform), serialize (internal PHP format, allows restore objects with types), or session serialization format (fucking shit).
[[https://dzone.com/articles/polyglot-persistence-in-nosql-space][Serialize data like PHP session]].


session_encode: hw|i:33;
serialize: a:1:{s:2:"hw";i:33;}


** Lifecycle callbacks


** Exceptions

Just some thought on handling exceptions


You should catch an exception most closer to code which throws it 

Isn't it more convenient to catch it in one place?
