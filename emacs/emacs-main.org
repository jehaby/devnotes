Emacs has apropos! `M-x apropos`


* My emacs organization

* Bookmarks 

‘C-x r m’ – set a bookmark at the current location (e.g. in a file)
‘C-x r b’ – jump to a bookmark
‘C-x r l’ – list your bookmarks
‘M-x bookmark-delete’ – delete a bookmark by name
Your personal bookmark file is defined by option ‘bookmark-default-file’, which defaults to `~/.emacs.d/bookmarks`
